"This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in a "
"binary format.  The format is specific to Python, but independent of machine "
"architecture issues (e.g., you can write a Python value to a file on a PC, "
"transport the file to a Mac, and read it back there).  Details of the format "
"are undocumented on purpose; it may change between Python versions (although "
"it rarely does). [#]_"

"This is not a general \"persistence\" module.  For general persistence and "
"transfer of Python objects through RPC calls, see the modules :mod:`pickle` "
"and :mod:`shelve`.  The :mod:`marshal` module exists mainly to support "
"reading and writing the \"pseudo-compiled\" code for Python modules of :file:"
"`.pyc` files. Therefore, the Python maintainers reserve the right to modify "
"the marshal format in backward incompatible ways should the need arise. The "
"format of code objects is not compatible between Python versions, even if "
"the version of the format is the same. De-serializing a code object in the "
"incorrect Python version has undefined behavior. If you're serializing and "
"de-serializing Python objects, use the :mod:`pickle` module instead -- the "
"performance is comparable, version independence is guaranteed, and pickle "
"supports a substantially wider range of objects than marshal."

"Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects whose "
"value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be written "
"and read by this module.  The following types are supported: booleans, "
"integers, floating point numbers, complex numbers, strings, bytes, "
"bytearrays, tuples, lists, sets, frozensets, dictionaries, and code objects "
"(if *allow_code* is true), where it should be understood that tuples, lists, "
"sets, frozensets and dictionaries are only supported as long as the values "
"contained therein are themselves supported.  The singletons :const:`None`, :"
"const:`Ellipsis` and :exc:`StopIteration` can also be marshalled and "
"unmarshalled. For format *version* lower than 3, recursive lists, sets and "
"dictionaries cannot be written (see below)."
