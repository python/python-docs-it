"The :mod:`ensurepip` package provides support for bootstrapping the ``pip`` "
"installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment. This "
"bootstrapping approach reflects the fact that ``pip`` is an independent "
"project with its own release cycle, and the latest available stable version "
"is bundled with maintenance and feature releases of the CPython reference "
"interpreter."

"In most cases, end users of Python shouldn't need to invoke this module "
"directly (as ``pip`` should be bootstrapped by default), but it may be "
"needed if installing ``pip`` was skipped when installing Python (or when "
"creating a virtual environment) or after explicitly uninstalling ``pip``."
